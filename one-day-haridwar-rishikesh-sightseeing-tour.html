        <h2>Quick Overview</h2>
        <p>Haridwar and Rishikesh sit close to each other in Uttarakhand and together make a popular spiritual and adventure day trip. Haridwar is famous for its ghats on the Ganges and the evening Ganga Aarti. Rishikesh is known for its yoga centres, suspension bridges, and river-side cafes. In one day, you can taste both the devotional side and the calm adventure vibe.</p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>October to March:</strong> Cool and pleasant — best for sightseeing and outdoor activities.</li>
          <li><strong>April to June:</strong> Warm — mornings and evenings are comfortable; avoid midday for long walks.</li>
          <li><strong>July to September:</strong> Monsoon — lush green surroundings but expect rain and some road slowdowns.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>How to Reach (Simple Options)</h2>
        <p><strong>By road:</strong> From Delhi Haridwar is about 200–220 km and takes around 5–6 hours by car. Rishikesh is another 20–30 km north of Haridwar depending on the route.</p>
        <p><strong>By train:</strong> Haridwar has a major railway station with many trains from Delhi and other cities. Rishikesh now also has a railway station with fewer trains — check schedules in advance.</p>
        <p><strong>By air:</strong> The nearest major airport is Dehradun (Jolly Grant Airport) about 20–35 km from Rishikesh and 30–45 km from Haridwar. From the airport, a taxi or cab is the best option.</p>

        <h2>One-Day Itinerary — Clear Timings</h2>
        <p>This sample plan assumes you start early from Haridwar or arrive from nearby towns. Times are flexible — use them as a guide.</p>

        <h3><span class="time">06:00 – 08:00</span> — Start at Har Ki Pauri, Morning Walk &amp; Ganga Aarti</h3>
        <p>Begin at <strong>Har Ki Pauri</strong>, the most famous ghat in Haridwar. If you reach early, the morning is peaceful and you can watch devotees offer water (aarti is more famous in the evening). Walk along the Ganges, take a dip if you follow local customs, or simply enjoy the cool riverside breeze.</p>

        <h3><span class="time">08:00 – 09:30</span> — Breakfast &amp; Visit Mansa Devi / Chandi Devi (Optional)</h3>
        <p>Enjoy a local breakfast — simple North Indian food or light snacks from popular stalls. If you like short cable car rides and views, visit <strong>Mansa Devi</strong> or <strong>Chandi Devi</strong> temples via ropeway. Both offer wide views of the town and river.</p>

        <h3><span class="time">09:30 – 11:00</span> — Drive to Rishikesh &amp; Laxman Jhula</h3>
        <p>Drive to Rishikesh (roughly 30–45 minutes depending on traffic). Start at <strong>Laxman Jhula</strong> — the famous suspension bridge. Walk across, enjoy the shops, and breathe in the river-side calm. This place has many small temples and a lively but relaxed vibe.</p>

        <h3><span class="time">11:00 – 12:30</span> — Explore Ram Jhula &amp; Riverside Cafes</h3>
        <p>Visit nearby <strong>Ram Jhula</strong> and the ashram area. Rishikesh has several cafes and simple restaurants along the river — a light tea or snack at a riverside cafe is a pleasant pause.</p>

        <h3><span class="time">12:30 – 14:00</span> — Lunch &amp; Short Rest</h3>
        <p>Choose a clean, well-reviewed cafe or local restaurant for lunch. Many places offer vegetarian and sattvic food, ideal for the spiritual mood. Rest briefly before the afternoon activities.</p>

        <h3><span class="time">14:00 – 16:00</span> — Optional Activities (Yoga, Short Trek or Ganga Beach)</h3>
        <p>Rishikesh offers yoga classes, short nature walks and gentle treks nearby. You may prefer a beginner yoga session (many centres offer 60–90 minute classes) or visit a quiet river beach to relax. If you like mild adventure, book a short rafting session with a licensed operator (afternoon seasons vary).</p>

        <h3><span class="time">16:00 – 18:30</span> — Evening Aarti at Triveni Ghat (Rishikesh) or Return to Haridwar</h3>
        <p>Rishikesh holds evening prayers and chants near the ghats; attend the <strong>Ganga Aarti</strong> at Triveni Ghat if available. If you prefer the grand evening aarti in Haridwar, return there and join the evening ceremony at Har Ki Pauri. Both experiences are calm and memorable.</p>

        <h3><span class="time">18:30 – onwards</span> — Dinner and Departure</h3>
        <p>Have dinner at a recommended place or head back to your onward transport. If you are staying overnight, choose a riverside guesthouse or a mid-range hotel for a peaceful night.</p>
