      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Kutch is a large district in western Gujarat. It is known for wide salt flats, desert-like landscapes, small villages, colourful craft, and a rich local culture. The Rann of Kutch is famous for the white salt plain that shines under sunlight and the moon. People visit Kutch for nature, culture, festivals and photography. A Kutch tour package helps you see the main places easily and can include travel, hotels, guide and transport.</p>

      <p>This guide uses simple words and clear steps. Whether you are a first-time visitor or planning to return, this page will help you choose the right package and prepare well.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why choose a Kutch tour package?</h2>
      <p>There are several reasons to book a package rather than plan alone:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Saves time:</strong> Packages include routes and hotels so you do not waste time planning day-to-day travel.</li>
        <li><strong>Local knowledge:</strong> Guides know the best viewpoints, handicraft shops and local food places.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport is arranged:</strong> The roads in Kutch are long. Packages include private car or coach which makes travel easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety and comfort:</strong> At night, it is better to stay in recommended hotels. Packages include good stays.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Types of Kutch tour packages</h2>
      <p>You can find different package styles. Choose the one that fits your time and interest.</p>
      <h3>1. Short weekend packages (2–3 days)</h3>
      <p>These are quick trips for people with limited time. They usually cover the main Rann and a nearby town. Short packages are best if you live close by or plan a short break.</p>

      <h3>2. Standard packages (4–6 days)</h3>
      <p>Most travelers pick a 4–6 day package. These cover the Rann of Kutch (Great Rann and Little Rann), Bhuj city, traditional villages like Kutch's craft villages, and local museums. This length gives you time to visit the craft centres and the salt desert and to watch the sunset over the Rann.</p>

      <h3>3. Extended and bespoke packages (7+ days)</h3>
      <p>If you want to go slow, take photography tours, or visit remote villages, choose an extended package. Some operators also offer tailored packages for families, photographers, or researchers.</p>

      <h3>4. Festival packages</h3>
      <p>The Rann Utsav is a popular festival that runs for months, usually in winter. Festival packages include cultural shows, special camps in the white desert, local food and craft markets. These are more expensive but offer a rich cultural experience.</p>
