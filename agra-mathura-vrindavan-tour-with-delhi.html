        <h2>Why this trip works well</h2>
        <p>This short tour covers Delhi, Agra, Mathura and Vrindavan. It mixes history, culture, temples and calm walks. You will see the world-famous Taj Mahal, the red stone beauty of Agra Fort, the holy places of Mathura and the devotional mood of Vrindavan. The distances are short and the roads are good, so you can move comfortably between places in three days.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
        <p>To enjoy the trip comfortably, choose these months:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>October to March:</strong> Cool and pleasant days — best for sightseeing.</li>
          <li><strong>April to June:</strong> Hot and sunny — early morning visits are better.</li>
          <li><strong>July to September:</strong> Monsoon — fewer crowds but expect rain and humid weather.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Morning and late afternoon are the best times for outdoor sightseeing because days can get warm.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>How to Reach & Move Around</h2>
        <p>All four places are well connected by road and rail. Here are easy options:</p>

        <h3>Arriving in Delhi</h3>
        <p>Delhi has the main international and domestic airports (Indira Gandhi International). From Delhi you can start the tour by car or train. Many travellers prefer to begin in Delhi and then head to Agra by road or by train.</p>

        <h3>Delhi to Agra</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>By road:</strong> 200–230 km, about 3.5 to 5 hours depending on the route and traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>By train:</strong> Fast trains like Gatimaan Express and Shatabdi connect Delhi and Agra (around 1.5 to 3 hours).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Agra to Mathura & Vrindavan</h3>
        <p>Mathura is about 55–60 km from Agra. Vrindavan is just 15–20 km from Mathura. You can hire a private car or take local trains and buses. A private car gives you more time and ease for temple visits.</p>

        <p class="note">Tip: For a smooth trip, hire a trusted driver or use a reputable tour operator who knows local timings and parking spots near monuments.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Suggested 3-Day Itinerary (Simple)</h2>

        <h3>Day 1 — Delhi: Quick City Highlights</h3>
        <p>Start your day in Delhi. If you arrive early, visit a few top spots like Qutub Minar, India Gate, Humayun’s Tomb or the busy market of Chandni Chowk. Keep this day light if you plan to leave for Agra in the evening or next morning. Rest well — the real sightseeing begins at Agra.</p>

        <h3>Day 2 — Agra: Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Mehtab Bagh</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Early morning:</strong> Visit the Taj Mahal at sunrise for a magical and less crowded view. Spend time walking around the gardens and the main tomb area.</li>
          <li><strong>Late morning:</strong> Have breakfast and then visit Agra Fort — a large red-sandstone fort with beautiful palaces and views of the Yamuna river.</li>
          <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Enjoy local food at a nearby restaurant; rest in your hotel if needed. Visit local marble shops or markets for souvenirs.</li>
          <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Head to Mehtab Bagh (across the river) for a gentle view of the Taj at sunset.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 3 — Mathura & Vrindavan: Temples and Devotion</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Morning in Mathura:</strong> Mathura is the birthplace of Lord Krishna. Visit Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi temple and the local ghats by the Yamuna river. The morning rituals are full of color and devotion.</li>
          <li><strong>Late morning to afternoon:</strong> Move to Vrindavan (about 30 minutes). Vrindavan is full of temples and peaceful lanes. Visit Banke Bihari Temple, ISKCON Temple, Radha Raman Temple and Prem Mandir (if you prefer a modern marble temple with light shows in the evening).</li>
          <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Enjoy the aarti (prayer) at the ghats or at a major temple — these ceremonies are an important part of the local experience.</li>
