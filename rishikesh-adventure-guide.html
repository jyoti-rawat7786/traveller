      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Rishikesh sits on the banks of the Ganges and mixes calm spiritual life with strong adventure sports.

    <section>
      <h2>Why Rishikesh for Adventure?</h2>
      <p>Rishikesh has fast river stretches, good camping spots, and a long history of outdoor sports. The hills around the town are great for short treks and nature walks. Also, the town is small and easy to reach, so it works well for a weekend or a longer stay.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wide choice of activity levels — from easy to very challenging.</li>
        <li>Many trained guides and operators with local knowledge.</li>
        <li>Beautiful scenery — forested hills, river views and sunsets.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
      <p>Choose the time based on weather and water level:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Summer (March to June):</strong> Warm weather, good for rafting and camping. Water level is moderate to high.</li>
        <li><strong>Monsoon (July to September):</strong> Heavy rains often close rafting and some roads. Not the best time for adventure.</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn (October to November):</strong> Clear skies and cooler weather — great for all activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Winter (December to February):</strong> Cold but possible for some activities; river water is colder and mornings foggy.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Top Adventure Activities</h2>
      <p>Here are the main outdoor activities you can do in Rishikesh. Each section has quick tips and what to expect.</p>

      <h3>River Rafting</h3>
      <p>River rafting is the most popular activity. The Ganges near Rishikesh has different stretches suited to beginners and experts.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Grades:</strong> River sections are often rated from Grade I (easy) to Grade IV (challenging). Some special runs may reach Grade V in high water.</li>
        <li><strong>Popular stretches:</strong> 9 km, 16 km and 26 km routes are common. Shorter runs are good for families and beginners.</li>
        <li><strong>Typical trip:</strong> Lasts from 1 hour to half a day depending on the distance. Most trips include safety brief, life jacket, helmet, and guide.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <strong>Safety tip:</strong> Always choose a licensed operator, wear a life jacket and helmet, and follow the guide’s instructions. If the water looks too rough, cancel or change plans.
      </div>

      <h3>Camping & Glamping</h3>
      <p>Camping by the Ganges is peaceful. There are basic camps and more comfortable glamping sites with beds and clean toilets.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What to expect:</strong> Tents, sleeping bags, bonfires, simple food and early river views.</li>
        <li><strong>Good for:</strong> Groups of friends, couples, and families who like quiet nights under the stars.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Pick a camp that provides clean drinking water and a safe place to store valuables.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bungee Jumping & Flying Fox</h3>
      <p>Bungee jumping in Rishikesh is one of the highest in India and attracts thrill-seekers. Flying fox or zipline is a fast ride between two points across a valley.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Runs by trained staff only. Check that the operator uses modern harnesses and regular equipment checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Who should avoid:</strong> People with heart problems, recent injuries, or pregnant women should avoid bungee and similar high-impact activities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Kayaking & Riverboarding</h3>
      <p>Kayaking is for people who want to learn river skills, and riverboarding lets you ride the water on a board. Many schools provide beginner lessons and gear.</p>

      <h3>Trekking & Nature Walks</h3>
      <p>Short treks around Rishikesh give great views and a quiet escape. Common walks lead to waterfalls, viewpoints, and small villages.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose easy treks if you are new to hiking.</li>
        <li>Carry water, snacks, and a small first-aid kit.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Yoga, Meditation & Chill Activities</h3>
      <p>Rishikesh is a spiritual town and many people mix adventure with yoga and meditation to balance energy and recover from strong activities.</p>
      <p>A morning yoga class by the river is a nice way to start a day after a night of camping.</p>
