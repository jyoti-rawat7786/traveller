        <h2>Quick overview</h2>
        <p>Kedarnath is one of the holiest shrines in the Himalayas and a key stop on the Chardham yatra. The shrine sits at high altitude and offers a strong spiritual experience along with mountain views. Pilgrims can reach Kedarnath by trekking from Gaurikund or by helicopter services that land at nearby helipads. This guide covers what to expect, month-wise weather, the trek basics, helicopter booking and simple staying tips.</p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Weather — month-wise (simple)</h2>
        <p>Kedarnath’s weather changes quickly. Here is a simple, month-by-month look so you can plan:</p>
        <h3>April – Early May</h3>
        <p>Roads start to open and snow begins to melt. Days are cold but manageable in sunlight. Expect chilly nights and possible snow patches on the trek.</p>
        <h3>May – June (Peak Visiting Time)</h3>
        <p>These are the best months to visit. Weather is clearer, days are pleasant and nights are cold. This is the main yatra season when temples are open and services run normally.</p>
        <h3>July – September (Monsoon)</h3>
        <p>Monsoon brings rain and the risk of landslides. The valley becomes very green, but travel can be delayed or risky. Operators add buffer days in this season.</p>
        <h3>October</h3>
        <p>Post-monsoon offers clear skies and cool weather. Many pilgrims visit in September–October before winter closes the high routes.</p>
        <h3>November – March (Winter)</h3>
        <p>Heavy snow closes the high routes and the temple often shuts down for the winter. Travel is not recommended unless you have winter-specific plans and support.</p>
        <div class="note">Tip: Always check local opening dates—these change slightly every year and depend on weather and official announcements.</div>

        <h2>Trek details — Gaurikund to Kedarnath (easy read)</h2>
        <p>The common trek to Kedarnath starts at <strong>Gaurikund</strong>. Over recent years the route has been rebuilt and restored after the 2013 floods, but it remains a mountain trek. Here are the basics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Around 16 km one-way from Gaurikund to Kedarnath. The path is a mix of stone steps, trails and short bridges.</li>
          <li><strong>Time:</strong> Most walkers take 5–8 hours depending on pace and fitness. Some prefer to split into two days with an overnight stay at a midway guesthouse.</li>
          <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate to hard — high altitude, long uphill sections and uneven paths. Good fitness helps; rest often and drink water.</li>
          <li><strong>Support:</strong> Ponies, palkis (sedan chairs) and porters are available for hire on the trail for those who need help. Book them early in peak season.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practical trek tips:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start early in the morning to avoid afternoon weather changes.</li>
          <li>Wear good walking shoes and layers; use trekking poles if you have them.</li>
          <li>Carry water, energy snacks, basic medicines and a small first-aid kit.</li>
          <li>Take breaks often; listen to your body — altitude and steep climbs can tire you quickly.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Helicopter services — what to know</h2>
        <p>Helicopter rides are a fast way to reach the Kedarnath area and are popular with pilgrims who cannot trek or prefer a shorter travel time. Here is a clear guide to helicopter options and booking:</p>
        <h3>Where helicopters land</h3>
        <p>Helicopters typically operate to and from nearby helipads such as <strong>Phata, Sersi (Sirsi) and Guptkashi</strong>. From these helipads, short transfers or ground travel connect to temple areas or take you to the final landing spots near Kedarnath.</p>
        <h3>How to book</h3>
        <p>Helicopter bookings are commonly done through official portals and authorised operators. The national rail tourism portal IRCTC runs a dedicated booking service for yatra helicopter seats in many seasons. Booking opens before the yatra season and seats fill fast during peak months.</p>
        <h3>Cost and timing</h3>
        <p>Prices vary by route, seat type and season. Helicopters save long trekking time but add to the budget. Booking early is wise — last-minute seats are limited and weather can cause delays or cancellations.</p>
        <h3>Safety and rules</h3>
        <p>Heli services follow strict safety checks. However, flights are weather-dependent; authorities may suspend flights in heavy rain or low visibility. Expect strict luggage limits and safety briefings at helipads.</p>
        <div class="note">Book through official channels and check refund/cancellation rules. If you plan a helicopter seat, buy a flexible plan and keep buffer days for weather delays.</div>

        <h2>Kedarnath stay guide — where to rest and what to expect</h2>
        <p>Accommodation near Kedarnath ranges from basic dharamshalas and tented camps to a few comfortable guesthouses. Keep expectations aligned with the mountain setting — facilities are simple and focused on pilgrim needs.</p>
        <h3>Types of stay</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dharamshalas & Ashrams:</strong> Budget-friendly, basic bedding and shared bathrooms. These are good for pilgrims on a low budget.</li>
          <li><strong>Tented camps:</strong> Seasonal camps with mattress, blankets and shared toilets—often warmer and more private than basic dharamshalas.</li>
          <li><strong>Guesthouses & Hotels:</strong> Small guesthouses near the temple offer private rooms and basic hot water facilities; limited in number and fill up early in peak season.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Booking tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reserve in advance during May–June and September–October. Options fill quickly in peak season.</li>
          <li>If trekking, plan whether you want to overnight on the trail — some pilgrims rest midway to manage the climb better.</li>
          <li>Expect higher prices near the temple during the peak season; booking early gives more choices and better rates.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Food and facilities</h3>
        <p>Food near Kedarnath is simple and mostly vegetarian during peak yatra season. Hotels and dharamshalas provide hot meals, tea and simple snacks. Hot water can be limited in remote stays, so ask in advance and pack warm clothing and a thermos if needed.</p>

        <h2>Sample plan — mix of trek and heli options</h2>
        <p>Here are two visitor-friendly plans depending on fitness and budget:</p>
        <h3>Plan A — Trekker (Budget to Mid-range)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Day 1: Reach Guptkashi / Sonprayag and stay overnight.</li>
          <li>Day 2: Drive to Gaurikund and trek to Kedarnath (16 km). Overnight near the temple.</li>
          <li>Day 3: Morning darshan and descend to Gaurikund; drive back to base town.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Plan B — Helicopter & Short Walk (Comfort)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Day 1: Drive to Guptkashi or selected helipad and take helicopter to Kedarnath landing (short walk to temple).</li>
          <li>Day 2: Morning darshan and return by helicopter to pickup point; travel back to your base.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Both plans need buffer days for weather delays. Carry extra days in your itinerary and avoid tight same-day returns on the yatra.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Important tips for a smooth yatra</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep copies of ID and booking confirmations (heli, hotels, permits) in digital and paper form.</li>
          <li>Carry cash — ATMs are limited and often out of service during peak months in remote towns.</li>
          <li>Respect local customs at the temple — dress modestly and follow queue rules during darshan.</li>
          <li>Listen to local authorities about weather and road safety — follow their advice if routes are closed or limited.</li>
          <li>Buy travel insurance if possible, and check the operator's emergency support before booking.</li>
        </ul>
