        <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
        <p>Choosing the right time for Chardham yatra matters. The shrines are in high hills and roads open seasonally. Here are clear windows to plan your trip:</p>
        <h3>Opening Season (Late April — June)</h3>
        <p>This is the most popular start period. Snow melts, roads open and weather becomes mild. Days are pleasant and nights are cool. It is a busy time but good for clear skies and comfortable travel.</p>
        <h3>Monsoon & Mid-Season (July — September)</h3>
        <p>Monsoon brings lush green views. However, heavy rain can cause landslides and slow travel. Many operators still run tours but they add buffer days and flexible routes. If you travel in monsoon, be ready for delays.</p>
        <h3>Post-Monsoon (October — Early November)</h3>
        <p>This short window after monsoon and before winter is another good time. The air is clear and roads are stable. Nights start to get cold, so pack warm clothing.</p>
        <h3>Winter (November — March)</h3>
        <p>Winter is the off-season. Many high roads close due to snow and some shrines are not accessible by road. Travel is not advised unless you plan for low-altitude alternatives or a specialized winter yatra.</p>
        <p class="note">Tip: Always check yearly opening/closing dates. Local authorities announce road and temple schedules and these sometimes change with weather.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Yatra Route Details — Simple Circuits</h2>
        <p>Chardham yatra usually covers four shrines: Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath. Operators often choose routes depending on road conditions and time. Below are common route options explained simply.</p>

        <h3>Standard Clockwise Route (Popular)</h3>
        <p>Start from Haridwar or Rishikesh, and travel in this order:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Yamunotri:</strong> Drive to Barkot and visit Yamunotri for its hot springs and the temple.</li>
          <li><strong>Gangotri:</strong> Move to Uttarkashi and then to Gangotri, the origin of the Ganga river.</li>
          <li><strong>Kedarnath:</strong> From Guptkashi or Sonprayag, trek or take a helicopter to Kedarnath shrine.</li>
          <li><strong>Badrinath:</strong> After Kedarnath, head towards Joshimath and then to Badrinath for darshan.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This route keeps the travel direction smooth and is used by many packages.</p>

        <h3>Alternative Routes & Helicopter Options</h3>
        <p>Some travellers take helicopter transfers to Kedarnath to avoid long treks. Helicopters save time but cost more and are weather-dependent. Operators sometimes reverse the order or mix routes to match road openings and to offer shorter driving days.</p>

        <h3>Typical Day Count</h3>
        <p>Standard packages vary from 8 days (fast pace) to 12+ days (comfortable pace). Choose based on your health, travel style and how many buffer days you want for weather or rest.</p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>How to Reach — Simple Options</h2>
        <p>Most Chardham trips begin from one of these entry points: Haridwar, Rishikesh, Dehradun, or Delhi. Here are practical ways to reach those hubs and start the yatra.</p>

        <h3>From Delhi</h3>
        <p>Delhi is the most common starting city. From Delhi you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drive (private car or taxi) — long but flexible.</li>
          <li>Take a train to Haridwar or Rishikesh, then continue by road.</li>
          <li>Fly to Dehradun (Jolly Grant) and start from there with shorter drives.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>From Haridwar or Rishikesh</h3>
        <p>These towns are convenient launch points. Haridwar has a major railhead and good bus services. Rishikesh is just up the road and both towns offer many tour operators and vehicles for hire.</p>

        <h3>Local Travel on the Route</h3>
        <p>Once on route, travel is mostly by road in SUVs, tempo travelers or coaches. Mountain roads are narrow and drivers are experienced. For Kedarnath, the final stretch may require a trek or a helicopter.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <strong>Quick travel tip:</strong> If you prefer less driving, choose packages with helicopter transfers for Kedarnath. They save time but add to cost and are subject to weather.

        <h2>Important Travel Tips — Practical & Safe</h2>
        <p>These tips come from experienced travellers. They are simple and will make the yatra easier and safer for you.</p>
        <h3>1. Health & Altitude</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Start slow: if you are not used to hills, allow a day to acclimatize before high-altitude stops.</li>
          <li>Stay hydrated and eat light meals on travel days.</li>
          <li>Carry basic medicines for headache, stomach and motion sickness. A pulse oximeter can help monitor oxygen at higher stops.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Clothing & Packing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pack warm layers: fleece, a light down jacket and thermal innerwear especially for Kedarnath and Badrinath nights.</li>
          <li>Bring waterproofs and good walking shoes. Roads can be wet in monsoon and dusty on dry days.</li>
          <li>Carry a small daypack for temple visits and short walks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Documents & Money</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Carry ID proofs (Aadhaar or passport) and copies. Keep digital copies on your phone or email.</li>
          <li>Carry enough cash for small purchases — ATMs are limited in remote towns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Booking & Operator Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Book with a local operator who has a clear cancellation and contingency plan for weather and road blocks.</li>
          <li>Confirm what the package includes: meals, hotels, permits, driver allowances and helicopter (if any).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Respect & Local Customs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Dress modestly for temple visits and follow local traditions for offerings and darshan.</li>
          <li>Be patient with queues and local schedules — mountain timings are slower and more relaxed.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">Carry a small first-aid kit and any regular medicines. If you have chronic health problems, get medical advice before the trip.</div>
