        <h2>Quick Overview</h2>
        <p>Kainchi Dham is an ashram and Hanuman temple tucked in the green hills near Nainital, Uttarakhand. It is known for Neem Karoli Baba (Maharaj-ji) and draws a mix of local devotees and travellers who come to seek peace, attend aarti or simply enjoy quiet hill air. The place is simple in spirit — focus is on devotion and calm rather than amenities.</p>
        <p>This guide covers what to pack, how to behave, how to reach, sample one-day plans, health and safety tips, and nearby places to add to your trip.</p>

        <h2>Before You Go — Practical Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check opening hours:</strong> The ashram usually opens early (around 6:45 AM) and closes in the evening; Tuesdays often have extended kirtan and later closing time.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan transport:</strong> Decide whether you will drive, hire a taxi from Kathgodam, or fly to Pantnagar and take a cab onward.</li>
          <li><strong>Reserve accommodation (if staying):</strong> Nearby Nainital or Bhimtal offer many options; book in advance during peak season.</li>
          <li><strong>Local weather:</strong> Check weather before packing; hill mornings can be chilly even in summer.</li>
          <li><strong>Cash & essentials:</strong> Small shops may not accept cards — carry cash and basic medicines.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>How to Reach — Simple Routes</h2>
        <p><strong>By road:</strong> Kainchi Dham is reachable by car or taxi. From Delhi it is around 300–320 km and takes about 7–8 hours by road depending on traffic. From Nainital and Bhimtal it is a short drive.</p>
        <p><strong>By train:</strong> Kathgodam is the nearest major railhead. From Kathgodam the drive to Kainchi Dham is typically 35–45 km (1–1.5 hours depending on traffic).</p>
        <p><strong>By air:</strong> Pantnagar airport is the closest airport (roughly 70–75 km away). From Pantnagar expect a 2–3 hour taxi ride due to winding roads.</p>

        <h2>Packing List for First-Time Visitors</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Comfortable walking shoes and light warm layer for mornings/evenings.</li>
          <li>Reusable water bottle and small snacks (fruit, nuts) — though there are tea stalls, having your own supply is handy.</li>
          <li>Basic medicines for motion sickness, headache and stomach upsets.</li>
          <li>Respectful clothing (shoulders and knees covered). A shawl or scarf helps in cool weather and is useful inside the temple.</li>
          <li>Small cash notes for donations, prasad, and local stalls.</li>
          <li>Mobile power bank and offline maps if you expect weak signals in the hills.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Etiquette & Temple Manners</h2>
        <p>Visiting a sacred place is also about respect. Follow these simple rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remove shoes before entering inner temple areas unless instructed otherwise.</li>
          <li>Keep voices low — many visitors come for silence and prayer.</li>
          <li>Ask before taking photos; some places or rituals may prohibit photography.</li>
          <li>Follow queues during darshan and be patient. Avoid pushing or hurried behaviour.</li>
          <li>If offered prasad or a community meal, accept politely and follow the local customs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>One-Day Example: A Calm & Simple Plan</h2>
        <p>This plan is gentle and leaves space for quiet — ideal for many first-time visitors.</p>
        <h3>Early Morning</h3>
        <p>Reach early and join the morning aarti. The early hours are quiet and feel sincere. Spend some time walking around the ashram grounds and enjoying the clean air.</p>
        <h3>Late Morning</h3>
        <p>Take darshan at the Hanuman temple, visit Neem Karoli Baba’s darshan hall and sit for a while in silence. Have a simple breakfast nearby — tea and light snacks.</p>
        <h3>Afternoon</h3>
        <p>Walk to nearby viewpoints or rest close to the river/stream. Enjoy a light lunch at a local dhaba or eat prasad if available.</p>
        <h3>Evening</h3>
        <p>Return for evening aarti. If you are there on a Tuesday, stay for kirtan — it can be a moving experience. After aarti, slowly make your way back to your vehicle or onward transport.</p>

        <h2>Health & Safety Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hilly roads can be narrow — if you drive, slow down on bends and avoid night driving on unfamiliar mountain routes.</li>
          <li>Carry water and stay hydrated. Avoid heavy meals before long drives.</li>
          <li>Mobile signal may be patchy; keep emergency numbers written down and share your route with someone before you leave.</li>
          <li>If you have medical conditions, carry your medicines and a copy of prescriptions.</li>
        </ul>
