    <h2>Best Time to Visit Himachal Pradesh</h2>

    <p>
        Himachal looks beautiful throughout the year, but every season gives a different experience.

        If you wish to experience snowfall, then November to February is the ideal time. During this period, Manali, Shimla, Kufri,
        Solang Valley, and Spiti attract the maximum number of tourists. But keep in mind that some roads might remain closed due to snow,
        so proper planning is necessary.

        During monsoon, Himachal becomes completely green and fresh. Though there is a slight landslide risk, this season is amazing
        for couples and photographers.
