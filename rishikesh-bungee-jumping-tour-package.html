        <h2>Why choose Rishikesh for Bungee Jumping?</h2>
        <p>Rishikesh is one of India's top adventure hubs. It sits by the Ganges river, surrounded by green hills. Here you will find one of the highest bungee jumping platforms in India. The jump site offers a clean, professional setup, trained staff and clear safety rules. Many travellers pick Rishikesh because the jump is paired with other activities like river rafting, short treks and yoga, so you can have a full fun day.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect on the Day</h2>
        <p>The bungee day is exciting and straightforward. Here is a simple flow of events:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pickup & Transfer:</strong> You will be picked up and driven to the jump site.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety Briefing:</strong> Trained staff explain the jump, safety rules and demonstrate gear fitting.</li>
          <li><strong>Gear & Medical Check:</strong> Staff fit harnesses and check your health status briefly (you will be asked about any medical problems).</li>
          <li><strong>Jump:</strong> You climb the platform, get ready and jump under instruction. The staff monitor everything and guide you during the fall and rebound.</li>
          <li><strong>Photos & Video:</strong> Many operators offer photos and a short video clip of the jump as a memory.</li>
          <li><strong>Return:</strong> After the activity, you return to the pickup point or continue any add-on activities like rafting or lunch.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Safety — What You Need to Know</h2>
        <p>Safety is the top priority for all good operators. Simple safety notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Certified gear: Ropes, harnesses and platform are inspected and maintained. Ask your operator about their safety checks.</li>
          <li>Trained staff: Well-trained staff guide you before, during and after the jump.</li>
          <li>Medical check: You will be asked simple questions about heart problems, recent surgery, pregnancy or bone issues. People with these conditions are not allowed to jump.</li>
          <li>Age and weight limits: Most operators set age and weight limits. Check these before booking.</li>
          <li>Insurance: Adventure insurance can help, but verify with the operator what they provide and what you need to buy separately.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">If you have doubts about your health, consult a doctor before booking. Never hide medical conditions — safety staff need to know.</p>
